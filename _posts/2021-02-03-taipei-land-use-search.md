I've been working on research of Taipei transportation for weeks and recently require the land area of each land use of all villages. The search engine by the government is not designed for searching by administrative geo-space, nor does the public data provides such stats. As a result I decide to put things together by myself, and open to anyone who's interested.



#### Go to "[Taipei Land Use Quick Search](https://dubidub.github.io/tp_landuse)".
