I created a [web application](https://dubidub.github.io/traffic_accident) that visualises road safety data in Taiwan cities. By using [Kepler.gl](Kepler.gl), a powerful geospatial analytical tool, the traffic crash hot zones and peak time of day are identified.
I enjoyed this interesting side project very much. The data I used here is also shared in the app.
